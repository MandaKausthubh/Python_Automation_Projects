# NUMPY!! #
## Why use Numpy Arrays overlists ? ##
1. Numpy is faster as it uses fixed datatypes, whereas lists have multiple datatype storage.
2. Works as a replacement of MATLAB.
3. Plotting
4. Backend

## Using NumPy Arrays: ##
1. import numpy as np
2. a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
3. If we have function that takes in data-types and we can use this function for Arrays as well. The function is applied element-wise.
